## ✨ What Is the Glow Mod?

The **Glow Mod** is a stripped-down ESP tool that adds soft-colored outlines or glows to enemy (and optionally friendly) players — even behind walls or obstacles. Unlike full ESP overlays that flood your screen with info, this cheat is minimal and focused: *you see them, they don’t see you*.

It’s the most discreet way to track your opponents in real time, while keeping your screen clean and your gameplay looking legit. 😎

* Combine with **low-FOV aim assist** for ultra-legit performance

## ⚠️ Detection & Safety Notes

* Use **private loaders** — public versions get flagged fast
* Don’t stack glow with rage aimbot unless you’re trolling
* Never flick through walls — glow shows, but shooting does the talking
* Keep it simple, stay quiet, and you’ll avoid reports
* Don’t stream with glow unless using “stream-proof” mode

Glow-only mods are some of the **lowest detection-risk cheats** if used cleanly.
